# Mass-Effect-Trilogy-Guide

This guide is spoiler free with exception of squadmate and mission names. You can use this on a first playthrough.

This guide combines all of the guides I made for the previous games into one post. I have also updated all of them to be slightly better and to include almost every mission/assignment.

Using this guide for squadmate recommendations is NOT recommended if you are looking for the most effective squadmates in each mission. The guide focuses on unique dialogue, not effectiveness in a mission.

Mass Effect 1

I will be going over every single assignment in the game with the exception of the collection assignments. UNC Asari Writings is the only one that has an impact on a later game. I will mention if an assignment either is affected by your background or has an impact on ME2 or ME3.

Unlike ME2 and ME3, you can skip almost all side missions with little consequence. If you are not looking to 100% ME1 I would recommend ignoring most of the assignments that don’t have impact on ME2 or ME3.

ME1 has far less unique dialogue from squadmates than ME2 or ME3. Very few missions will have recommended squadmates.

Most missions/assignments have multiple names. I will either be using whatever name the mission has when first received or in the case of the UNC missions, whatever name they have when the have “UNC” in the name.

Eden Prime: N/A - Before interacting with beacon, go to the left of it for a cutscene.

Citadel: Expose Saren/Citadel: Garrus/Citadel: Shadowbroker: N/A - These missions all tie in with each other. In the wards, there is a cutscene when you interact with the middle window if Kaidan and Ashley are in your party. If you speak to Harkin before Barla Von, there is an extra scene with Wrex. When confronting Fist do not bring Wrex if you wanna be able to spare him. Fist shows up in ME2 if spared. After defeating Fist make sure to pick up his OSI drive in order to complete Reporter’s Request.

Citadel: Reporter’s Request: N/A - This mission has an impact on ME2.

Citadel: Scan the Keepers: Anyone - This assignment is a pain. This mission has an email in ME2 that you only receive if you make specific choices in Citadel: Jahleed’s Fears. If you are not a completionist I would ignore this assignment. It’s still worth scanning any keepers you run into even if you don’t fully complete the assignment.

Citadel: Jahleed’s Fears: Anyone - This assignment ties in with the previous one.

Citadel: Rita’s Sister: Kaidan and Ashley or Garrus and Anyone - Kaidan and Ashley have dialogue together. Garrus has unique dialogue during the mission. This mission has an impact on ME3

Citadel: The Fan: Anyone - This assignment requires you to come back 2 other times. Once after completing one main planet and once again after another main planet. This mission has an impact on ME2 and ME3.

Find Liara T’Soni: Anyone - Liara is on Therum in the Knossos system of the Artemis Tau cluster. This mission has unique dialogue if you do it 3rd or 4th. Doing so will mean that you cannot romance Liara. Talk to Anderson and Udina sometime after this mission for some dialogue.

Bring Down the Sky: Anyone - This DLC rewards you with a lot of morality points. Do this mission now if you wanna pass the speech check during the ship inspection.

UNC Major Kyle: Anyone - This mission has unique dialogue if you chose the Ruthless background.

UNC Hostage: Kaidan and Anyone - Kaidan has unique dialogue in this mission. This mission has an impact on ME2.

UNC Missing Survey Team: Anyone

UNC Rogue VI: Anyone - This mission only unlocks after reaching level 20 (or 10 in Legendary mode). This mission has an impact on ME2 and ME3. This mission unlocks a specialization of your choice. Do NOT skip this mission.

Citadel: Snap Inspection: Kaidan/Ashley and Anyone - They both have some dialogue with the Admiral however only one of them triggers if both are with you.

Citadel: The Fourth Estate: Anyone - This mission has an impact on ME2 and ME3. This mission has unique dialogue if you do it after Feros or Noveria, however it’s best done now if you wanna pass the charm check on Feros.

Makes sure to buy the Elkoss Combine license from Expat. Buying one has an impact on ME3.

Not a mission but Garrus and Wrex have dialogue with Executor Pallin.

Citadel: Homecoming: Ashley and Anyone - Ashley as unique dialogue with a character in this mission. This mission has an impact on ME2.

Citadel: Family Matter Anyone - This mission has an impact on ME2 and ME3.

Citadel: Presidium Prophet: Anyone

Citadel: Asari Consort/Xeltan’s request: Liara/Ashley/Kaidan and Wrex - Wrex has dialogue with Septimus. Your LI has a single line with the Consort if you have locked them in by this point (which is possible only if you have done enough assignments by this point). Complete Xeltan’s Request before finishing Asari Consort in order to receive a reward. This mission has an impact on ME2, ME3, and the Citadel DLC in ME3.

Citadel: Planting a Bug: Anyone - This mission has an impact on ME2. This mission rewards more morality points if you use the charm/intimidate check on Emily Wong after recovering the bug but before planting the big.

Citadel: Doctor Michel: Garrus and Anyone - Garrus has some dialogue with Michel. This mission has an impact on ME2 and ME3.

Citadel: Old, Unhappy, Far-Off Things: Anyone - Spacer exclusive mission. This mission has an impact on ME2.

Citadel: Old Friends: Anyone - Eathborn exclusive mission. This mission has an impact on ME2.

Citadel: I Remember Me: Anyone - Colonist exclusive mission. This mission has an Impact on ME2.

The next 3 assignments are acquired on the Citadel. Pick up all 3 before doing them.

UNC Privateers: Anyone - You can turn this in on a later visit to the Citadel if you want although you’ll miss out on 2 morality points.

UNC Asari Diplomacy Anyone - This mission has an impact on ME2. You can turn this in on a later visit to the Citadel if you want although you’ll miss out on 2 morality points.

UNC Hostile Takeover: Anyone - This mission has an impact on ME2.

UNC Lost Module: Anyone - The planet this mission takes place on has an orb that you can only interact with if you received the amulet from Xeltan’s request.

After doing all of these missions you should have enough to pass the 12 charm check on Feros if you were going full paragon. You earn about 40 paragon points on Feros before the charm check so if you have 65% of your paragon meter filled up you should be good. The intimidate check is much easier so if you are going renegade or paragade you only need 25% renegade points to get 10 points in intimidate. If you do Noveria before Feros you can easily pass the speech checks however it is recommended to do Feros first because the story works much better if you do it before Noveria.

Feros: Anyone - Everyone has roughly the same amount of lines. Make sure to do the 4 assignments at Zhu’s Hope to earn some paragon points. Gavin Hossle has an assignment with an impact on ME3. Talk to Anderson and Udina sometime after this mission for some unique dialogue.

UNC Exogeni Facility: Anyone

UNC Colony of the Dead Anyone

UNC Lost Freighter: Anyone

UNC Espionage Probe: Anyone - This mission has unique dialogue if you chose the War Hero background.

Wrex: Family Armor: Wrex and Anyone - This is Wrex’s personal mission so bring him. Bring someone else who has decryption if you aren’t a tech class. AFAIK this is the only mission in the game where decryption is required to complete the mission.

Garrus: Find Dr. Saleon: Garrus and Anyone - Garrus is recommended for this mission because it’s his personal mission. This mission has an impact on ME2.

UNC Geth Incursions: Tali and Anyone - This mission ties into Tali’s personal mission so I think it’s fitting to bring her. Make sure to get the the Geth data on Solcrum for Tali’s mission.

Tali and the Geth: N/A - Talk to Tali on the Normandy after picking up the Geth data in UNC Geth Incursions. This mission has an impact on ME2.

UNC Distress Signal: Anyone

UNC Derelict Freighter: Anyone

Citadel: Schells the Gambler: Anyone

Citadel: Signal Tracking: Anyone

Pinnacle Station: Anyone - This DLC is not in Legendary Edition. Around now would be a good time to do it because you should be a high enough level for it not to be too challenging while still being able to use the rewards.

Noveria: Lorik Qui’in Garrus and Wrex - Garrus and Wrex have a lot to say in the first half of Noveria, especially if you are a renegade. Everyone else has some but still far less dialogue and nowhere near as funny as Garrus or Wrex. Replace Liara with Garrus or Wrex if you don’t wanna go back to the Normandy before heading to Peak 15. Ashley has dialogue with Anoleis is you’re an Earthborn and Tali has dialogue with him if you’re a Spacer.

Noveria: Smuggling: Anyone

Noveria: Espionage: Anyone

Noveria: Peak 15: Liara and Wrex - Liara has dialogue with her mom. Wrex has dialogue regarding the Rachni. If you aren’t a tech class you can swap Wrex with someone else if you wanna be able to hack containers. Talk to Anderson and Udina after this mission for some dialogue.

Noveria: Quarantine: Anyone

Noveria: Hot Labs: Anyone - A lot of people don’t know this but if you do this mission after killing Benezia you can don’t have to kill the scientists.

UNC Listening Post Alpha: Anyone

UNC Listening Post Theta: Anyone

UNC Depot Sigma-23: Anyone

UNC Missing Marines: Anyone - Completing this and the next 2 missions has an impact on ME2. The reason I do this assignment so late is because this chain of assignments leads to some plot holes in the previous assignments.

UNC Cerberus: Anyone

UNC Hades Dogs: Anyone

UNC Dead Scientists: Anyone - This mission has unique dialogue if you choose the Sole Survivor background. This mission has unique dialogue if you do it after UNC Hades Dogs.

UNC Besieged Base: Anyone - This mission is unlocked upon reaching 80% Paragon or 90% if you reached 80% Renegade first. It is unlikely that you will be able to do both without exploits. This mission has an impact on ME2.

UNC the Negotiation: Anyone - This mission is unlocked upon reaching 80% Renegade or 90% if you reached 80% Paragon first. It is unlikely that you will be able to do both without exploits. This mission has an impact on ME2.

**Warning: Landing on Virmire is a point of no return. You will not be able to do any Citadel assignments that require you to leave after landing on Virmire. I recommend that you finish up any missions/assignments on the Citadel you want to do before going to Virmire.

Virmire Mako Section: Anyone

Virmire Salarian Camp: N/A - There are 2 codex entries you get through hacking that can only be obtained if you are a tech class.

Virmire Saren’s Base: Anyone

Citadel LockdownAshley and Wrex - I couldn’t find a name for this mission so I am calling it this. There are 2 assignments in the wards that are only available at this point. After leaving the Citadel you are not able to return so finish your anything you have left.

Citadel: Our Own Worst Enemy: Ashley and Wrex - Ashley has dialogue that gives some insight into her views on racism. Wrex has some funny lines.

Citadel: Negotiators Request: Anyone

Warning: This is the point of no return. Landing on Ilos locks you into the endgame. Finish up anything you want to do now.

Ilos Liara and Anyone - Liara has quite a lot of dialogue. Everyone has quite a few lines but for the most part they are all the same lines. Bring the Mako when going down the long corridor.

Mass Effect 2

ME2 has far more unique dialogue than ME1.

I will not be going over N7 missions because they can be done literally whenever and they have no impact on ME3 or any unique dialogue. Save a couple N7 missions for the post game in order to access all content in LotSB.

Prologue: Awakening: N/A

Freedom’s Progress: N/A

Citadel: The Council Anyone - Legion has unique dialogue but he isn’t available until the end of the game.

Citadel: Krogan Sushi: Anyone

Normandy: Special Ingredients: N/A

Dossier: the Master Thief: Anyone

Dossier: the Veteran: Anyone

Omega: Bartarian Bartender: Anyone

Omega: Struggling Quarian: Anyone

Dossier: the Professor: Zaeed and Kasumi - Aliens have unique dialogue in this mission but the Warlord recruitment mission has unique dialogue for Mordin and the Archangel mission has unique Dialogue for Grunt. So that means that Mordin works best first imo. Zaeed and Kasumi have far more dialogue than Jacob and Miranda. Make sure to find Mordin’s assistant for a missable assignment.

Dossier: the Warlord: Mordin and Anyone - Mordin has unique dialogue and is really useful for this mission.

Dossier: the Convict: Miranda and Grunt - Miranda has some dialogue with Jack if you bring her and Grunt has some funny lines.

Dossier: Archangel: Zaeed and Grunt - Both of these characters have full conversations with some of the characters in this mission. Pick up the datapad next to the eclipse leader for a missable assignment.

Horizon: Garrus/Miranda/Mordin - Garrus has some things to say to a character in this mission. Mordin has some dialogue regardless of if you take him with you or not, but it is slightly altered if he is with you. It’s fitting to bring Miranda here for spoiler reasons.

Dossier: Tali: Garrus and Anyone - Garrus simply because he is a ME1 character and so is Tali. While not recommended for a first playthrough, Legion has a unique scene in this mission if you bring him.

Illium: Gianna Parasini: Anyone

Illium: Liara: Systems Hacking: Anyone

Illium: Liara: The Observer: Anyone

Illium: Conrad Verner: Anyone

Illium: Medical Scans: Anyone

Illium: Blue Rose of Illium: Anyone

Dossier: the Assassin: Anyone - Any squad is fine. I like using both Tali and Garrus because this is the first mission with both of them and the antagonist of it is a ME1 character. Be sure to pick up the Salarian’s family data for a missable assignment.

Illium: Indentured Service: Tali and Anyone

Dossier: the Justicar: Thane and Anyone - Thane has some dialogue referencing the princess bride. Make sure to read the shipping note and to pick up the smuggling evidence for 2 missable assignments.

After doing all of the recruitments, it’s time for the loyalty missions. This is the order I like to do them in but you can do whatever. The order doesn’t matter for the most part. Just be sure to not to do Tali’s until after the IFF. You are still able to romance her if you do this.

Tuchanka: Killing Pykaks: Anyone

Mordin loyalty: Garrus/Tali - Garrus has a line that gets referenced in the citadel DLC in ME3 if you brought him here. Tali has one funny line. Make sure to pick up the combustion manifold and find the lost Krogan scout for 2 missable assignments.

Grunt loyalty: Garrus/Mordin/Anyone - Garrus has a funny line with Wrex at the start. I think that it makes the most sense for Mordin’s character arc if you bring him but he has no interesting dialogue. Nobody has any dialogue in this mission

Collector ship: Anyone - Every single character has unique dialogue here so bring who you want.

Firewalker missions: Anyone - I think it gives you a nice change of pace if you do Firewalker about here.

Jacob loyalty: Mordin - Mordin has a lot more to say than other squadmates in this mission.

Normandy: FBA Couplings: N/A - Doing this mission after recruiting Tali allows her to join the poker game.

Omega: The Patriarch: Anyone

Omega: Packages for Ish: Jacob and Miranda - Jacob and Miranda both have unique dialogue with Ish. In the Original game if you have played Mass Effect: Galaxy and connected it to your account, they have even more unique dialogue.

Garrus loyalty: Anyone

Citadel: Crime in Progress: Tali and Anyone - Tali has unique dialogue in this mission.

Thane loyalty: Tali/Garrus - They both have a single funny line.

Citadel: False Positives: Anyone

Zaeed loyalty: Garrus/Anyone - No lines here for any squadmates but I think it fits for Garrus to be here because he can see what he could’ve become if had continued being so vengeful. It also explains Garrus and Zaeed’s friendship in the Citadel DLC.

Kasumi loyalty: N/A - This mission does give you an amazing weapon if your not playing Soldier and can be done super early. I just think this mission feels out of place if you do it too early. If you are playing on insanity do this one early. This mission also has unique dialogue depending on what missions you have already completed. Doing it this late gives you all of the unique dialogue.

Samara loyalty: Anyone

Miranda loyalty: Jack/Anyone - Jack has a single line while everyone else has no lines. If you feel bad about bringing Jack to something so personal to Miranda than you can bring someone else. Make sure to pick up the locket for a missable assignment.

Jack loyalty: Miranda - Miranda has a lot to say here and doing it late makes Miranda turning on Cerberus flow a bit better.

Project overlord: Tali/Jacob/Miranda - I think it’s good for Miranda and Jacob to see the bad side of Cerberus and Tali because of the Geth. You do miss out on the dialogue for Legion but this DLC doesn’t really make any sense to do after unlocking them because it would have to be post game. Doing Overlord in the post game makes no sense depending on your choices during the suicide mission.

Normandy: Serrice Ice Brandy: N/A - This can be done much earlier but I think it fits to do here because of the next mission.

Normandy crash site: N/A - This feels like Shepard’s loyalty mission to me so I like to do it as the last loyalty mission (besides Tali and Legion). It also feels much more impactful imo if you do it later.

Reaper IFF: Tali and Thane/Samara - Tali has a lot of dialogue for this mission and you get a conversation with her (or Garrus/Jacob but they do take priority over Tali’s if you brought them). Samara and Thane add to that conversation. After completing the IFF do NOT do any N7 missions or DLC until the post game.

Tali loyalty: Legion - This mission has the most unique dialogue in the entire game for a single character. Bringing Legion is a must. It’s still possible to romance Tali before the suicide mission if you do it this late.

Legion loyalty: Tali - Not too much more dialogue than the other squadmates but it fits.

Before starting the Suicide Mission I recommend obtaining 300,000 total minerals. This will give you a war asset in ME3.

Suicide mission: Anyone - Send Tali into the vents and Jack on barrier duty for some dialogue in ME3. Kasumi has some dialogue as well in ME3 if she is sent through the vents. Garrus/Jacob/Miranda should lead the 2nd group. Mordin should be the escort if everyone isn’t loyal. If everyone is loyal then I like to send Thane because I like the idea of an assassin protecting people.

Suicide mission final push: Miranda and Anyone - Miranda gets some unique dialogue if you bring her to the end. There is a mechanic where the characters you leave behind have to defend a door. For the best results DON’T bring Zaeed, Garrus, or Grunt.

Lair of the Shadow Broker: Anyone - The rewards for this mission are super useful but you can’t really use them if you do it this late. It fits the story best if you do it late imo but if you want to use the rewards then do it earlier. If you romanced Liara in ME1 you miss out on the dialogue if you cheated on her if you do this DLC early.

Arrival: N/A - This should be the very last thing you do before ME3.

Mass Effect 3

This guide assumes that every single ME2 squadmate survives the suicide mission, but the only ones that are extremely important to the guide are Tali and Garrus.

Unlike ME2, all squadmates in ME3 have lots of dialogue in every single mission.

I will not be listing every single Citadel fetch quest but I will be listing the more interesting Citadel side missions. I will be mentioning every single mission on the Citadel that expires as well, even if it is a fetch quest.

In ME3 your squadmates on the Normandy all have interactions/conversations with you or someone else after pretty much every single mission, including the From Ashes and Leviathan DLC. Just something small I thought was worth mentioning.

Prologue Earth: N/A

Priority Mars: N/A - I don’t normally put choices here but because so many people miss this. Make sure to chose the left dialogue option with TIM in order to charm/intimidate him.

Priority the Citadel I: N/A

N7 Cerberus lab: James and Liara

Priority Palaven: James and Liara

Priority Eden Prime: Anyone - This can technically be done whenever but you earn a squadmate so I recommend doing it early so you can get all of his dialogue. Each squadmate has their own set of unique dialogue in this mission. If you want to use Kaidan/Ashley or Tali, you can wait to do this mission until after they are recruited but that’s not recommended. Doing so will miss out on a lot of Javik’s dialogue. Make sure to find all of the Cerberus intel to get a war asset.

Visit the Citadel and do some side missions.

Citadel: Alien Medi-Gel Formula: N/A - This mission expires if not completed before Priority: Tuchanka.

Aria: Blue Suns: N/A

**Aria: Blood Pack: N/A

Aria: Eclipse: N/A

Citadel: Hanar Diplomat: N/A - This mission expires if not completed before Priority: Tuchanka.

Ismar Frontier: Prototype components: N/A - This mission expires if not completed before Priority: Tuchanka.

Grissom Academy: EDI and Garrus/Liara - EDI has dialogue with a character if you completed Overlord in ME2 and Jack has a a funny comment about her. Garrus has dialogue with Jack and someone else if you completed Overlord. Liara has something interesting to say about Jack and some comments on biotics. Warning: Ignoring this mission has major consequences if you don’t do it before Priority the Citadel II.

Priority Sur’Kesh: Garrus and Liara - Garrus and Liara both have a lot to say on this mission. They are both amazing together in this mission. Javik and EDI have some funny lines as well if you have used Garrus and Liara in the past.

N7 Cerberus attack: Anyone

Visit the Citadel and do some side missions.

Citadel: Barla Von: N/A - This mission expires if not completed before Priority: Tuchanka.

Citadel: Improved Power Grid: N/A - This mission expires if not completed before Priority: Tuchanka.

Citadel: Biotic Amp Interfaces: N/A - This mission expires if not completed before Priority: Tuchanka.

Tuchanka Turian platoon: Garrus and Anyone - Garrus makes the most sense and has dialogue about the Turians. Tali does have a very long bit of dialogue post mission that you can only get if you do this mission after Priority Rannoch. I do not recommend doing this because you’ll miss out on dialogue between Wrex and Victus and it’s really bad for the pacing of the story if you wait. Warning: Ignoring this mission has major consequences if you wait until after Priority Thessia.

Tuchanka bomb: Garrus and Anyone - Garrus for the same reasons as the previous mission. Warning: This mission has major consequences if you do 3 missions before it once it’s obtained.

Attican Traverse Krogan Team: Javik and Garrus - Javik and Garrus both have some interesting dialogue with Grunt and Javik has some things to say about the Rachni. Be on the lookout for the message from a dead Krogan. Unlike the the other side missions, you cannot buy the message from the Spectre requisitions terminal. Tali has unique dialogue here but it’s not worth waiting and it fits the story better to do it before Priority Tuchanka.

N7 Cerberus Abductions: Anyone

Visit the Citadel and do some side missions.

Benning: Evidence: N/A - This mission expires if not completed before Priority: Tuchanka.

Warning: After finishing Priority Tuchanka a lot of side missions on the Citadel will disappear. It is recommended to complete all the Citadel side missions that I have mentioned up to this point.

Priority Tuchanka: Anyone - Nobody in particular has anything to say that’s more interesting than the others.

N7 Cerberus fighter base: Anyone

Priority the Citadel 2: Anyone - Pretty much everyone has unique dialogue. My favorite combinations are Garrus and Anyone, EDI and Anyone, and James and Javik.

Do some Citadel side missions.

Citadel: Wounded Bartarian: N/A

Citadel: Bartarian Codes: N/A

Citadel: Inspirational Stories N/A

Citadel Medi-Gel Sabotage: N/A

Citadel: Cerberus Retribution: N/A

Ex-Cerberus Scientists: Kaidan/Ashley and EDI - Kaidan and Ashley have some things to say about Cerberus. EDI has a funky joke about a returning character.

Ardat-Yakshi Monastery: Liara and Anyone - Liara has a lot to say. Everyone else is about equal in terms of dialogue. Make sure to pick up the message from one of the dead Asari. You cannot buy it from the Spectre requisition terminal.

Do some Citadel side missions.

At this point you can initiate a romance by talking to any of your squadmates. I recommend talking to the character you want to romance first or else you’ll have to reject each character directly. If you do the conversations after locking in a romance with someone else, the dialogue will be about how good of a friend you are instead of how they wanna be in a relationship with you. If you are romancing Tali wait until after the Geth Dreadnaught to have these conversations. If you are romancing Miranda wait until you do her 3rd encounter to do these conversations.

Citadel: Medical Supplies: N/A

Citadel: Volus Ambassador: N/A

Omega DLC: N/A - I think that the Omega DLC fits best here. This is one of 2 points in the game where nothing happening in the main story is urgent. I also feel like it fits here because it feels like your retaliating against Cerberus for the Citadel coup. Cerberus also doesn’t show up for a long time after this point so it feels like a bigger surprise that they return if you do this now.

Priority Perseus Veil: N/A

Priority Geth Dreadnaught: Garrus/James/EDI/ME1 LI - If you romanced Tali in ME2 make sure to lock your romance in with her or whoever you want to romance before this mission. If you cheated on your ME1 LI with Tali in ME2 than bring your ME1 LI. If you are romancing Garrus, then bring him. If you romanced Tali but didn’t cheat on a ME1 LI, bring James or EDI for some funny dialogue. If you never romanced Tali or Garrus you can bring anyone.

Visit the Citadel and do side missions.

N7 Fuel Reactor: Anyone

Rannoch Admiral Koris: Tali and EDI/James - Tali has the most unique dialogue. James has a funny interaction if you have him disarm the AA tower. EDI has something interesting happen to her at the start. Warning: This mission expires after Priority Rannoch and can potentially have major consequences if ignored.

Rannoch Geth Fighter Squadrons: Tali and Anyone - Everybody besides Tali gets like 1 extra line. Warning: This mission expires after Priority Rannoch. Not doing this mission has major consequences.

Visit the Citadel and do side missions.

Priority Rannoch: Tali and Anyone - Javik will get slightly different dialogue in the post mission conversation on the Normandy but for such an important mission I would recommend just bringing your favorite.

Visit the Citadel and do side missions.

Priority Thessia: Javik and Liara - Bring Javik because this is the mission with the most unique dialogue for a single squadmate in the game. Make sure to use the left dialogue in a conversation at the end of the mission in order to charm/intimidate TIM.

N7 Communication Hub: Anyone

Priority Horizon: Kaidan/Ashley and Anyone - I like to bring the Virmire survivor because they were here in ME2 but they have no particularly interesting dialogue. AFAIK nobody else has anything interesting to say.

Visit the Citadel and do side missions.

Leviathan DLC: N/A - I really struggle to find a good place for this DLC. No matter when you do it, it gets in the way of the pacing or introduces plot holes. You can spread the 3 missions throughout the game if you want but doing so feels very awkward to me. If you do spread it out I think it works best if you do the 1st mission after Omega DLC. The 2nd mission after Rannoch. And the 3rd after Thessia. Either way no matter what you do this DLC fits really awkwardly into the story so I’m just gonna recommend doing it all at the end after Horizon.

Leviathan Mahavid: EDI and Anyone - EDI has some interesting things to say.

Leviathan Namakli: Anyone

Leviathan Despoina: Your LI and Anyone - Your LI has a unique scene with you if you bring them.

Citadel DLC: N/A - Do this DLC as the very last thing you do before the point of no return.

Silver Coast Casino Infiltration: Your LI - This mission has a lot of dialogue for every single character. I personally recommend either your LI or Wrex.

Citadel Archives: Wrex and Your LI - Your LI has unique dialogue. If you can’t bring your LI or Wrex is dead than you can replace them with anyone else.

Citadel Docks: Retake the Normandy: Anyone - EDI has a unique scene on the shuttle if you bring her. If you brought Garrus to Mordin’s loyalty in ME2 you he has unique dialogue in this mission. Every single squadmate combo has multiple interactions with each other so I recommend bringing whoever you want.

Citadel aftermath: N/A - At this point you explore the Silversun strip. In your apartment you can receive emails from some characters requesting to meet up. After doing the meetups, exit and reenter your apartment to receive more. Joker and Wrex have an unmarked meeting at the bar in the casino. Kasumi has an interaction by clicking on the suspicious device on the left side of the casino ground floor. To meet up with Jack you have to play the Armax Arsenal Arena first, then she will email you.

Priority Cerberus Headquarters: Your LI - Your LI has some unique dialogue when watching the video logs. Choose the left dialogue option to be able to charm/intimidate TIM.

Priority Earth 1st half: James/Kaidan/Ashley and Anyone - James/Kaidan/Ashley react to something that but only one of them can speak.

Priority Earth middle section: N/A - I’m only putting this here because a lot of people seem to miss it. When you are saying all of your goodbyes, there is a room behind Kaidan/Ashely that lets you say goodbye to your ME2 squadmates and Cortez.

Priority Earth 2nd half: Your LI and Anyone - Your LI gets a special scene if they are with you. If they aren’t with you, you get a different scene with one of the squadmates you brought with you.

Thank you so much for using my guide! If you see anything I could change please let me know so I can improve those guide.
